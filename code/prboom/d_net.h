// this is just mapped over the ticcmd_t array when setup packet is sent
//
// Note: the original code takes care of startskill, deathmatch, nomonsters
//       respawn, startepisode, startmap
// Note: for phase 1 we need to add monsters_remember, variable_friction,
//       weapon_recoil, allow_pushers, over_under, player_bobbing,
//       fastparm, demo_insurance, and the rngseed

//and G_ReadOptions(), which were specifically designed to set up packets.
//By creating a separate struct and functions to read/write the options,
//you now have two functions and data to maintain instead of just one.
//If the array in g_game.c which G_WriteOptions()/G_ReadOptions() operates
//on, is too large (more than sizeof(ticcmd_t)*BACKUPTICS), it can
//either be shortened, or the net code needs to divide it up
//automatically into packets. The STARTUPLEN below is non-portable.
